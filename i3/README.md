# i3

This is my i3 configuration.  A constant work in progress, but it continues to
work well for me.

#  Enhancement Exploration List

The Enhancement Exploration List is an ever growing list of things that I want
to explore.  Some I have already tried, didn't like but want to try again.
Other are new ideas I've never tried before.  Either way, I'm always open to
suggestions.

1. Smart terminal spawning - Mod+Return opens new ghostty in current directory of focused terminal
2. Picom compositor - Transparency, shadows, animations for modern look
3. Polybar status bar - More customizable than i3status with better visuals
4. Scratchpad workflows - Quick-access floating windows (terminal, notes, etc.)
5. Autotiling script - Automatic split direction based on window size
6. Clipboard manager - Access clipboard history with hotkey
7. Screenshot improvements - Flameshot for annotations and better UX
8. Lockscreen customization - i3lock-color with custom images/effects
9. Workspace-specific layouts - Auto-restore window layouts per workspace
10. Named scratchpads - Multiple scratchpads for different purposes
