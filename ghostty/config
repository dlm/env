# === Window/Desktop Integration ===
# This disables the gtk title bar.
# In the case of i3, it allows us to get the same i3 highlighting
# as in other applications.
# Note that when changing this, you will need to close all windows
# and restart ghostty for the change to take effect.

# === Appearance ===

# === Behavior ===
mouse-hide-while-typing = true

# === Keybindings ===
# Custom scroll keybinds optimized for nav-layer ergonomics:
# - Hold 'a' (nav mode) + 's' (ctrl) + 'u/i' for line scrolling
# - Add 'd' (shift) for 5-line scrolling

# Single line scrolling (fine control)
keybind = ctrl+page_up=scroll_page_lines:-1
keybind = ctrl+page_down=scroll_page_lines:1

# Multi-line scrolling (faster but still granular)
keybind = ctrl+shift+page_up=scroll_page_lines:-5
keybind = ctrl+shift+page_down=scroll_page_lines:5
